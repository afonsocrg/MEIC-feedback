# IST Feedback

## Honest reviews. Smarter choices.

**IST Feedback** is a platform where you can discover what each IST course is really like, through honest, anonymous reviews from fellow students.

- **Know what to expect before enrolling** — avoid bad courses, find the best ones for you.
- **Share your own experience** — help other students make informed decisions. Your review is always anonymous.
